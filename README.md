# Auto-Kick
This is a Pyrogram bot that allows group admins to schedule kicks for users in their group. The bot saves the user ID and kick time to a MongoDB database, and performs the kick at the scheduled time.

## Installation
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/irymee/Auto-Kick.git
cd Auto-Kick
python3 bot.py
```
